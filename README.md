# Hello World Program in C++

## Purpose
This repository contains a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It serves as a basic example of a C++ program, demonstrating the structure and syntax of a typical C++ application.

## Understanding the Code
The `hello_world.cpp` file contains a simple program that includes the following elements:

1. **Header File:** `#include <iostream>` - This line includes the Input/Output stream library, which is necessary for using `std::cout`.

2. **Main Function:** `int main()` - This is the main entry point of the program. The `main` function is where the execution of the program begins.

3. **Output Statement:** `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;` - This line prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console. The `std::cout` object is used to output data to the standard output stream, and `std::endl` is used to insert a newline character and flush the stream.

4. **Return Statement:** `return 0;` - This line terminates the `main` function and returns a value of 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program ended successfully.

## How to Run the Code
To compile and run the `hello_world.cpp` program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `hello_world.cpp` file.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
